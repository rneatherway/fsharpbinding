# Archive of F# Language Support for Open Editors

This repository previously contained the advanced editing support for F# for a number of open editors. It is now purely an archive of that development. The individual projects can now be found at:

* [F# mode for Emacs](https://github.com/fsharp/emacs-fsharp-mode)
* [F# mode for Vim](https://github.com/fsharp/vim-fsharp)
* [F# mode for Sublime Text](https://github.com/fsharp/sublime-fsharp-package)
* [F# mode for Atom](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Atom)
* Shared backend component [FSharp.AutoComplete](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.AutoComplete)
* [Monodevelop support(https://github.com/mono/monodevelop/tree/master/main/external/fsharpbinding)
